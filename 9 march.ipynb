    "The normal distribution is crucial in statistics and many fields because it naturally describes many phenomena and forms the basis for many statistical methods. Its importance includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Central Limit Theorem: This theorem states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution. This makes the normal distribution foundational for inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter Estimation: Many statistical techniques, such as confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, rely on the assumption of normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Analysis: Measurement errors often follow a normal distribution, making it essential in fields like engineering and physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-Life Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Human Traits: Heights, weights, and blood pressure of individuals within a population typically follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "Standardized Testing: Scores on exams like the SAT, GRE, and IQ tests are designed to be normally distributed.\n",

    "\n",
    "A Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution for a random variable which has exactly two possible outcomes: 1 (success) with probability \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Flipping a coin, where heads (success) could be assigned the value 1 and tails (failure) assigned the value 0.\n",
    "Difference from Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli distribution describes a single trial, while the binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "Example: Flipping a coin 10 times and counting the number of heads follows a binomial distribution.\n",

    "Uniform Distribution: A distribution where all outcomes are equally likely within a certain range. It can be continuous or discrete.\n",

    "𝑛≥30n≥30).\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows for the use of normal distribution in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation even when the underlying distribution is not normal.\n",
